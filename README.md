# GNOMY

A Python package for weather data gathering for further use.

---

## Quick Start



## Info

Gnomy began with my personal need to collect actual measured weather data rather
than typical meteorological year data in order to fit home energy models to measured
data. Having worked with the [Herbie python package](https://github.com/blaylockbk/Herbie),
this package has the goal to make parallelized collection of weather data and export
in the required format more accessible.
