# GNOMY

A Python package for weather data gathering for further use.

---

## Quick Start



## Info

The name "Gnomy" (while a working name) comes from the initial name of the effort
to create a _"NOAA-based AMY file"_. After being said repeatedly, "NOAA AMY" began
to mumble together into _"no-my"_ or gnomy.

Gnomy began with my personal need to collect actual measured weather data rather
than typical meteorological year data in order to fit home energy models to measured
data. Having worked with the [Herbie python package](https://github.com/blaylockbk/Herbie),
this package has the goal to make parallelized collection of weather data and export
in the required format more accessible.

## AMY Parameters

The columns of an AMY file are not labeled within the file itself. [The energy plus documentation](https://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/auxiliary-programs/energyplus-weather-file-epw-data-dictionary.html) identifies many if the fields of interest.

Below is a table of the values used, their limits, conventions for missing data, and the source of the data using gnomy

| Field | Name | Units | Min. | Max. | Missing | Used in Energy Plus | gnomy source |
|-------|------|-------|------|------|---------|---------------------|--------------|
|       |      |       |      |      |         |                     |              |
|       |      |       |      |      |         |                     |              |
|       |      |       |      |      |         |                     |              |
